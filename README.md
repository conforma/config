# Enterprise Contract Configuration Files

This repo contains a set of `policy.yaml` files which can be used with
Enterprise Contract and the Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline.

There is a predefined RHTAP Integration Test pipeline definition for each of
these configs which can be used when creating an Integration Test in RHTAP as
per the [documentation
here](https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/how-to-guides/proc_managing-compliance-with-the-enterprise-contract/).
